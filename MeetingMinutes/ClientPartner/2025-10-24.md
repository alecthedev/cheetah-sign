# Feedback

- Don't limit to just doc docx can expand to all the standard form types (Not a failure just something to stretch for)
- Met expectations for the iteration
- Keep a group bug log that allows us to have things we can work on while we are waiting on replies(Known issues)
- Don't fall in a pitfall of thinking you need to rewrite everything that is sloppy, less strive for perfection if good enough is good enough
