# Business Requirements 

**BR1: We are continuing the development of the Cheetah Sign application with the goal of implementing the needed features required to deploy the app in the Cheetah Flow system as a replacement for expensive and proprietary alternatives.**

We were tasked with finishing a previous capstone project where the initial application has been built, but is lacking key features needed for production. The key features required include storing audit trails and standard/frequently signed documents, allowing for multiple documents to be signed and to have multiple signers per document, and including field validation and implementing pre-filled data in the forms.
