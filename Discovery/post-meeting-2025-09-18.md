### Post-meeting Summary

*Written by Alec as a person reflection on the meeting.*

We met with our client and mentors from Cheetah on Thursday, 18 Sept 2025 to discuss the Cheetah Sign project and introduce ourselves. This meeting primarily focused on meeting each other and covering the basic overview of the project, because our project has already been started by previous years' students. This will require us to learn the software that already exists, and eliminates most of the initial planning stages of the project, such as determining tech stack and overall software design. 

We will sign an NDA on the project, and while we are waiting for these documents to be delivered we should spend time learning the tech stack. We were able to determine some priorities from the document that we initially received, and got a better idea of the expectations of this project.

The overall goal is to make improvements that could get the project to a level that Cheetah could potentially deploy to their customers (See the Minutes.md file in the Discovery directory for more specific notes on what we discussed.)

There are demos online of similar software from this domain, listed in the "Similar Tools" section of the original project document, that demonstrate several of the remaining features that they would like us to develop. These could help give us direction on the overall feel of the program. 

We will primarily be working with our mentor on this project, and once we have signed the papers we should determine the best method of contact. It is not clear whether he can be added to Slack, so we may need to stick to email for our client contacts.


### Questions
- When/how may we access the project?
	- After we sign NDA, could be a few days to get that.
	- In the meantime, work on learning tech stack (e.g. [vuemastery.com](vuemastery.com))
- Do you have any restrictions on the use of AI tools?
	- Only models that do not train on your data, which usually requires enterprise.
	- They will look into adding us to their plan
- Should our documentation be in a private repo?
	- All code will be in the project's Bitbucket
	- All documentation for the course can be in a public GitHub repo
