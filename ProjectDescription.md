# Project Description

## Summary
Cheetah Sign is an eSignature system being developed for Accutech as part of the Cheetah ecosystem. 
The project builds on work from the 2024–25 team and aims to expand the functionality so the system 
is closer to real-world deployment. The tool is designed to allow trust administrators and their 
clients to securely sign documents, manage workflows, and keep a complete audit trail of activity.

- UI/UX improvements for configuration screens  
- Standard document packets for quick re-use  


## Non-Functional Requirements
- Must maintain a secure audit trail for compliance

- Should be scalable to support multiple clients and larger document sets  
- Provide a responsive and user-friendly interface


## Constraints
